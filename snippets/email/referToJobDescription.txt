I'll try and summarize for you.

1. I was hired to clean up a mess.  I committed to cleaning up the mess. I was qualified to clean up the mess.  The scope was not decided as the mess had to be cleaned up.
2. The discussion on hiring was a permanent position that gave me the IP rights to my work and bootstrapping of my own company with a year of contract work to get me in without an interview issue w/ HR.  Those were my agreed upon terms of employment.  Also [firstWage] until I was [condition(s)].
3. Protect us from audit failure.  Don't build something that doesn't fix the problem.

That's it.

From where I sit, I've been doing my job consistently and without a single deviation.  I'm concerned about how many conversations I continue to have that are far away from this agreement and my actual hard work.  Which I have consistently documented along with the problems in documenting more for an audience that lacks the education to evaluate my work beyond what I already shared.  I'm not angry anymore, just very concerned.

I hope that sets things straight and helps.  I'm happy to move on.  But we need agreement that I am actually still doing my job as initially agreed to ðŸ™‚ Ok!
