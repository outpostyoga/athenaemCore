Hi [firstName],

I understand your frustration and emotions.  I actually thought long and hard about this wording and the workplace code of conduct between coworkers.  It is the most accurate illustration I could find to accurately convey how I felt.  I honestly was not exaggerating or expressing a derogatory thought.  It was an attempt to be as honest and as technically clear as I know how in an attempt to facilitate clear communication and problem solving.  It is actually how I felt.  I apologize for the unexpected [angryResponse] that it prompted and understand the lack of consideration that it undoubtedly conveyed.  That is definitely a sincere conversation I would love to have with you as a team member.  I hope you can separate these two things.  I often draw on illustrations and everyday life to convey concepts.  It is from my educational background.  I too have [angryResponseIllustrationContext].  They are why I felt comfortable referencing it as I am familiar with how I feel when interacting with [angryResponseIllustrationContext].

I hope that helps clear the air.  Honestly, I'm very sorry to hear about your [angryResponse].  I hope you understand my side of things a little better.
