Hi [firstName],

Sounds good.  Let's keep it a chat.  I really appreciate your concern.

So far, we have handled our problems as a team and have resolved them internally.  I'm surprised this one has ended up on your desk.  Our team does not do well if things descend into a legal battle and I don't want to even start down that path.  I'm happy to discuss things with you and keep it there.
