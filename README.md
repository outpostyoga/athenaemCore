# Rules.
1. Time is always Date.now ( ).  UTC timestamps in milliseconds.  Fuck you.
2. STRINGS. Javascript string concatenation is optimized for <1K characters <5 element strings and <10K loops. Otherwise arrays and .join() for the win.
3. // Commuter RR - X-Wing - Fighter Class Designation 34F23 'Commander G.'
