# athenaemCore
A solid Javascript library for localhost, data files and production insanity. Version 0.1744920307919 aka Southbound.

# Rules.
Because sometimes they are the elegant solution and the result of an incredible amount of work and self-discipline.

TIME. Time is always Date.now ( ).  UTC timestamps in milliseconds.  Fuck you.

STRINGS. Javascript string concatenation is optimized for <1K characters <5 element strings and <10K loops. Otherwise arrays and .join() for the win.

IN DEVELOPMENT.
1. // Commuter RR - X-Wing - Fighter Class Designation 34F23 'Commander G.'
2. let jsonInputArgs = cx.debug ? JSON.stringify ( Array.from ( arguments ) ) : undefined;
3. if ( cx.debug ) cx.log.line ( "[" + $0MM_i18n ( "AcString.js" ) + "][" + $0MM_i18n ( "$0M_assetTag" ) + "] " + jsonInputArgs + " " + $0V_result );
